                    <p>S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to control ownership of objects uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs. By default, Object Ownership is set to the Bucket owner enforced setting and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects 
                        in the bucket and manages access to data exclusively using access management policies. </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of <a href="./acl-overview.html">access control lists (ACLs)</a>. We recommend
                        that you disable ACLs, except in unusual circumstances where you must
                        control access for each object individually. To disable ACLs and take
                        ownership of every object in your bucket, apply the bucket owner enforced
                        setting for S3 Object Ownership. When you disable ACLs, you can easily
                        maintain a bucket with objects uploaded by different AWS accounts. </p>
                    <p>When ACLs are disabled access control for your data is based on policies,
                        such as the following: </p>
                    <div class="itemizedlist">

                    <p></p>
                    <p>Disabling ACLs simplifies permissions management and auditing. ACLs are
                        disabled for new buckets by default. You can also disable ACLs for existing
                        buckets. If you have an existing bucket that already has objects in it,
                        after you disable ACLs, the object and bucket ACLs are no longer part of the
                        access-evaluation process. Instead, access is granted or denied on the basis
                        of policies. </p>
                    <p>Before you disable ACLs, make sure that you do the following: </p>
                    <div class="itemizedlist">

                        AWS API requests. We recommend not storing AWS credentials directly in
                        the application or Amazon EC2 instance. These are long-term credentials that are
                        not automatically rotated and could have a significant business impact if
                        they are compromised.</p>
                    <p>Instead, use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for

                        don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a username and
                        password or access keys) to an Amazon EC2 instance or AWS service, such as
                        AWS Lambda. The role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use
                        when they make calls to other AWS resources.</p>

        <p>Several managed AWS security services can help you identify, assess, and monitor
            security and compliance risks for your Amazon S3 data. They can also help you protect your data
            from those risks. These services include automated detection, monitoring, and protection
            capabilities that are designed to scale from Amazon S3 resources for a single AWS account to
            resources for organizations spanning thousands of AWS accounts.</p>
        <p>AWS detection and response services can help you identify potential security
            misconfigurations, threats, or unexpected behaviors, so that you can quickly respond to
            potentially unauthorized or malicious activity in your environment. AWS data protection
            services can help you monitor and protect your data, accounts, and workloads from
            unauthorized access. They can also help you discover sensitive data, such as personally
            identifiable information (PII), in your Amazon S3 data estate.</p>
        <p>To help you identify and evaluate data security and compliance risks, managed AWS
            security services generate findings to notify you of potential security events or issues
            with your Amazon S3 data. The findings provide relevant details that you can use to investigate,
            assess, and act upon these risks according to your incident-response workflows and policies.
            You can access findings data directly by using each service. You can also send the data to
            other applications, services, and systems, such as your security incident and event
            management system (SIEM).</p>

                    <p>GuardDuty can monitor different kinds of activity for your Amazon S3 resources. For
                        example, CloudTrail management events for Amazon S3 include bucket-level operations, such
                        as <code class="code">ListBuckets</code>, <code class="code">DeleteBucket</code>, and
                        <code class="code">PutBucketReplication</code>. CloudTrail data events for Amazon S3 include
                        object-level operations, such as <code class="code">GetObject</code>,
                        <code class="code">ListObjects</code>, and <code class="code">PutObject</code>. If GuardDuty detects
                        anomalous or potentially malicious activity, it generates a finding to notify
                        you.</p>

                    <p>Amazon Detective simplifies the investigative process and helps you conduct
                        faster, more effective security investigations. Detective provides prebuilt data
                        aggregations, summaries, and context that can help you analyze and assess the
                        nature and extent of possible security issues.</p>
                    <p>Detective automatically extracts time-based events, such as API calls from
                        AWS CloudTrail and Amazon VPC Flow Logs for your AWS resources. It also ingests
                        findings generated by Amazon GuardDuty. Detective then uses machine learning, statistical
                        analysis, and graph theory to generate visualizations that help you conduct
                        effective security investigations more quickly.</p>
                    <p>These visualizations provide a unified, interactive view of resource
                        behaviors and the interactions between them over time. You can explore this
                        behavior graph to examine potentially malicious actions, such as failed login
                        attempts or suspicious API calls. You can also see how these actions affect
                        resources, such as S3 buckets and objects.</p>

                    <p>AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer (IAM Access Analyzer) can help you identify resources that
                        are shared with an external entity. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to validate
                        IAM policies against policy grammar and best practices, and generate IAM
                        policies based on access activity in your AWS CloudTrail logs.</p>
                    <p>IAM Access Analyzer uses logic-based reasoning to analyze resource policies in
                        your AWS environment, such as bucket policies. With IAM Access Analyzer for S3, you're alerted
                        when an S3 bucket is configured to allow access to anyone on the internet or
                        other AWS accounts, including accounts outside your organization. For example,
                        IAM Access Analyzer for S3 can report that a bucket has read or write access provided through a
                        bucket access control list (ACL), a bucket policy, a Multi-Region Access Point policy, or an access
                        point policy. For each public or shared bucket, you receive findings that
                        indicate the source and level of public or shared access. With these findings,
                        you can take immediate and precise corrective action to restore bucket access to
                        what you intended.</p>

                    <p>Amazon Macie is a security service that discovers sensitive data by using
                        machine learning and pattern matching. Macie provides visibility into data
                        security risks, and enables automated protection against those risks. With
                        Macie, you can automate the discovery and reporting of sensitive data in
                        your Amazon S3 data estate to gain a better understanding of the data that your
                        organization stores in S3.</p>
                    
                    <p>To detect sensitive data with Macie, you can use built-in criteria and
                        techniques that are designed to detect a large and growing list of sensitive
                        data types for many countries and regions. These sensitive data types
                        include multiple types of personally identifiable information (PII),
                        financial data, and credentials data. You can also use custom criteria that
                        you defineâregular expressions that define text patterns to match
                        and, optionally, character sequences and proximity rules that refine the
                        results.</p>
                    
                    <p>If Macie detects sensitive data in an S3 object, Macie generates a
                        security finding to notify you. This finding provides information about the
                        affected object, the types and number of occurrences of the sensitive data
                        that Macie found, and additional details to help you investigate the
                        affected S3 bucket and object. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/what-is-macie.html">Amazon Macie User Guide</a>.</p>

                        supported industry standards.</p>
                    <p>Security Hub then correlates and consolidates findings across providers to help you prioritize and process the most significant 
                        findings. It also provides support for custom actions, which you can use to invoke responses or remediation actions for specific 
                        classes of findings.</p>
                    <p>With Security Hub, you can assess the security and compliance status of your Amazon S3
                        resources, and you can do so as part of a broader analysis of your
                        organization's security posture in individual AWS Regions and across multiple
                        Regions. This includes analyzing security trends and identifying the
                        highest-priority security issues. You can also aggregate findings from multiple
                        AWS Regions, and monitor and process aggregated findings data from a single
