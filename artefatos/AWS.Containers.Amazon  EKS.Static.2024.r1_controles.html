    <table>
<tr><th>Control Name</th><th>Control ID</th><th>Justification</th><th>Mitigated Risks</th><th>Criticality</th><th>References</th></tr>
<tr><td>Implement Default Deny Network Policy</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0001</td><td>This control restricts all inbound and outbound traffic within the namespace by default, adhering to the principle of least privilege. It ensures that only explicitly allowed traffic can flow, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.</td><td>Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and potential lateral movement within the cluster.</td><td>High - Establishing a default deny policy is foundational for securing network communication in Kubernetes. It controls access and prevents exposure of sensitive data, making it crucial for maintaining a secure environment.</td><td>AWS EKS Best Practices - Network Security</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enable Network Policy Enforcement Logs</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0002</td><td>Monitoring the network policy enforcement through logs helps to ensure policies are correctly applied and functioning as expected. It provides critical insights into traffic flow and policy violations.</td><td>Misconfigured policies leading to unauthorized access, failure to detect network anomalies or breaches.</td><td>Medium - While not as immediate as denying all traffic, monitoring offers crucial insights and assists in maintaining security over time.</td><td>CloudWatch Container Insights</td></tr>
<tr><td>Utilize Secure Istio Configuration for mTLS</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0003</td><td>Implementing mTLS ensures secure, authenticated, and encrypted communications between microservices within a cluster, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.</td><td>Unauthorized data interceptions and potential data exfiltration.</td><td>High - mTLS is vital for maintaining confidentiality and integrity of the communications in service meshes.</td><td>Istio Security Authentication</td></tr>

<tr><td>Enable VPC Flow Logging</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0005</td><td>VPC Flow Logs capture detailed network traffic metadata which can be vital for security, troubleshooting, and audit purposes, providing visibility into traffic entering and leaving the network.</td><td>Undetected unauthorized access attempts, difficulties in troubleshooting network issues.</td><td>Medium - While not directly preventing network attacks, logs provide critical data necessary for detection and response efforts.</td><td>AWS VPC Flow Logs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Check CoreDNS Add-On Version</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0006</td><td>Ensuring the CoreDNS add-on version matches the EKS cluster's Kubernetes version is crucial for compatibility and stability in the EKS environment.</td><td>Incompatibility issues, potential outages, and security vulnerabilities due to outdated versions.</td><td>High - Mismatched versions can lead to operational failures or expose the cluster to security risks.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Disable Remote Access to EKS Cluster Node Groups</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0007</td><td>Disabling remote access prevents unauthorized access and potential security breaches.</td><td>Unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of EKS infrastructure.</td><td>High - Unauthorized access can lead to significant security incidents.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Restrict EKS Cluster Endpoint Public Access</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0008</td><td>Limiting public access to EKS cluster endpoints reduces exposure to external threats.</td><td>External attacks, unauthorized data access, and denial-of-service attacks.</td><td>High - Public exposure can lead to severe security vulnerabilities.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Assign Appropriate IAM Role Policies to EKS Node Groups</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0009</td><td>Ensuring EKS node groups have appropriate permissions minimizes the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized actions.</td><td>Privilege escalation, unauthorized actions, and compromised node groups.</td><td>Medium - Incorrect permissions can lead to security and operational issues.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Configure EKS Security Groups to Allow Incoming Traffic Only on TCP Port 443</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0010</td><td>Restricting incoming traffic to TCP port 443 enhances security by limiting unnecessary exposure.</td><td>Unauthorized access, security breaches, and data loss.</td><td>High - Improperly configured ports can be exploited by attackers.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enable CloudTrail Logging for Kubernetes API Calls</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0011</td><td>Logging API calls is essential for auditing, monitoring, and incident response.</td><td>Lack of audit trail, undetected security breaches, and compliance failures.</td><td>High - Absence of logs can severely impact monitoring and incident management.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enable Envelope Encryption for Kubernetes Secrets</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0012</td><td>Envelope encryption protects sensitive data stored as Kubernetes secrets by using AWS KMS.</td><td>Data compromise, unauthorized data access, and data integrity issues.</td><td>High - Unencrypted secrets are susceptible to being compromised.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Enable Kubernetes Cluster Control Plane Logging</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0013</td><td>EKS control plane logging is crucial for operational visibility and troubleshooting.</td><td>Lack of visibility, operational inefficiencies, and delayed incident response.</td><td>Medium - Without logging, identifying and resolving issues becomes challenging.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Use Latest Version of Kubernetes for EKS Clusters</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0014</td><td>Keeping Kubernetes versions up to date ensures access to the latest security patches and features.</td><td>Security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, and lack of new functionalities.</td><td>High - Outdated versions can lead to known vulnerabilities being exploited.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
<tr><td>Monitor Changes to Amazon EKS Configurations</td><td>AWS.Containers.Amazon EKS.Static.2024.0015</td><td>Monitoring configuration changes helps in detecting unauthorized modifications and ensuring operational consistency.</td><td>Unauthorized changes, configuration drift, and operational outages.</td><td>Medium - Unmonitored changes can result in unintended consequences that affect cluster stability.</td><td>Trend Micro Knowledge Base</td></tr>
