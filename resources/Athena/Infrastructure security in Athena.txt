Infrastructure security in Athena

As a managed service, Amazon Athena is protected by AWS global network security. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see AWS Cloud Security. To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see Infrastructure Protection in Security Pillar AWS Well‚ÄêArchitected Framework.

You use AWS published API calls to access Athena through the network. Clients must support the following:

Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.

Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal. Or you can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests.

Use IAM policies to restrict access to Athena operations. Whenever you use IAM policies, make sure that you follow IAM best practices. For more information, see Security best practices in IAM in the IAM User Guide.

Athena managed policies are easy to use, and are automatically updated with the required actions as the service evolves. Customer-managed and inline policies allow you to fine tune policies by specifying more granular Athena actions within the policy. Grant appropriate access to the Amazon S3 location of the data. For detailed information and scenarios about how to grant Amazon S3 access, see Example walkthroughs: Managing access in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. For more information and an example of which Amazon S3 actions to allow, see the example bucket policy in Cross-Account Access.
